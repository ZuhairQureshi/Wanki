What proteins link T-tubules and the sarcoplasmic reticulum? | DHP receptors and Ryanodine receptors
What is C8 and where is it located? | A spinal nerve! Below the cervical vertebra (C1-C7) and above the thoracic/lumbar vertebra
How do action potentials affect force production of the muscle? | action potentials cause release of Ca2+ into cells -- more action potentials means the sarcoplasmic reticulum remains open, so more Ca2+ enters muscle cells.
What are mammillary bodies responsible for? | Storing and collecting memories.
What are the names of the two spinal rami? What do they each innervate? | Dorsal (posterior) rami: deep back muscles, zygapophyseal joints; Ventral (anterior) Rami: everything else!
